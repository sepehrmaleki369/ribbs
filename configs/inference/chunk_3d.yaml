# Chunked Inference Configuration

# Patch size for inference [height, width]
# Patches of this size will be processed independently 
# and then reassembled to form the full output
# patch_size: [512, 512]
patch_size: [96, 96, 96]

# Patch margin [height, width]
# Margin of overlap between patches to avoid edge artifacts
# The effective stride will be (patch_size - 2*patch_margin)
# patch_margin: [100, 100]
patch_margin: [20, 20, 20]
