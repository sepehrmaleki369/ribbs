# Chunked Inference Configuration

# Patch size for inference [height, width]
# Patches of this size will be processed independently 
# and then reassembled to form the full output
patch_size: [64, 64]

# Patch margin [height, width]
# Margin of overlap between patches to avoid edge artifacts
# The effective stride will be (patch_size - 2*patch_margin)
patch_margin: [12, 12]
